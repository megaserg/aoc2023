# Advent of Code 2023

This year I'm solving it in Rust! I was thinking about maybe solving every day with a different language, but decided just to stick with Rust.

I'm creating a new directory for every day with the help of `init.sh` script. The solutions to Part 1 and Part 2 are called `a.rs` and `b.rs` correspondingly.
